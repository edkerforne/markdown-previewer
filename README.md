This is the source code for my [Markdown Previewer](https://edkerforne.github.io/markdown-previewer/), a React app which renders Markdown code as you type it.

It was made for the freeCodeCamp [front end libraries challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer). You can see the built code [here](https://github.com/edkerforne/markdown-previewer/tree/gh-pages).
